> Predicting melanoma skin disease


## Table of Contents
**Problem Statement:** Develop a CNN-based model to accurately detect melanoma, 
a deadly cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, to assist dermatologists in diagnosis by evaluating images.

**Dataset:** The dataset, from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), includes 2240 images (9 classes) of 
various malignant and benign oncological diseases, slightly dominated by melanoma and moles. It covers:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- Rebalancing the classes helped reduce overfitting and decrease the loss, but it also significantly lowered accuracy.

- Incorporating batch normalization and augmentation was effective in improving the model's performance.
